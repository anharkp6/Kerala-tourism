            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>	
                Wayanad antecedes to Paleolithic civilisation which is approximately 800 years old. Also, Edakkal caves in the district constitute 6000 years-old engravings from Neolithic civilisations. In addition to this, there is archaeological evidence which proves that forests of Wayanad are inhabited for more than 3000 years. Wayanad was ruled by rulers of several dynasties like the Kutumbiyas, Kadambas, Hoysalas, Vijayanagara empire etc. Amongst all the important Rajas, Pazhassi Raja of ancient Kottayam was the most powerful ruler of Wayanad. He lost his kingdom to Tipu Sultan. During the rule of Tipu Sultan, the place flourished and grew. However, it did not last long as the British East India Company was mushrooming their control across the country. In the year 1799, the British took over Wayanad and encouraged wealthy crop production. Therefore, over the years, tea, coffee and spices were cultivated on the fertile soils of Wayanad. At the time of colonial rule, a lot of infrastructural development took place in Wayanad. Earlier, Wayanad was a part of both Kerala and Karnataka. Hence, a significant percentage of the population speaks Kannada. However, the principal languages spoken are Malayalam and English. Later in November 1980, it was declared as the 12th district of Kerala formed out of land cravings of Kannur and Kozhikode.
